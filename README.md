# Background
Back when I started learning **Visual Basic**, I used to enhance my skills by making games. When I started learning 3D Designing using **SolidWorks**, I started participating in Low Feature Count Challenges (on [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/groups/cad-puzzles-riddles)) just to push my modelling skills to their limits.

Now, I challenged myself once more and decided to make another game. 408 lines of code later, I'm proud to share my first C++ project: 2048!

# Info
It took me ~2 days to finish it, but those 2 days were - definitely - worth it! It ended up being a dense learning session, not just a personal challenge/project.
After I released the first version on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ytkhedr/), I got lots of feedback and spend another 2 weeks improving the gameplay and adding more features to the game till it became what it is today.

To get some insight on the progression of the game, this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/follow-up-2048-my-first-c-game-yahya-t-khedr/) was written when the second version was released.

Hope you enjoy playing this game! :wink:
